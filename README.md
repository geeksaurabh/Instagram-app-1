# Spring Boot Application - Readme
This Spring Boot application is an example of a basic implementation of a RESTful API using Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and MySQL.

## Getting Started
- Clone the repository to your local machine
- Set up a MySQL database and update the application.properties file with your database configuration
- Build and run the application using Maven or your favorite IDE
- Structure
- The application follows a standard Spring Boot project structure:


# Model
- The model package contains the Post and User class, which is a simple POJO that represents a student.
-

# Repository
- The repository package contains the UserRepository and PostRepository interface, which extends the JpaRepository interface. This allows us to use the built-in methods for interacting with the database, as well as write custom queries.

# Service
  - The service package contains the Post and user class, which implements the userService and postService Interface. This class contains the business logic for the application, and it uses the StudentRepository to interact with the database.

# Controller
- The controller package contains the PostController and UserController class, which handles incoming HTTP requests and routes them to the appropriate StudentService methods. The controller also performs input validation and maps database entities to DTOs.
